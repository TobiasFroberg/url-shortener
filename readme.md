## What is this?

This is the millionth (give or take) URL shortener app. Literally nothing special going on here. I just wanted to play around with some Laravel tests including in-memory sqlite and what not.

Fun little project. PR's welcome (hello, Hacktoberfest), but must include tests!

## Contributing

Thinking of contributing? Awesome! Please only submit serious pull requests, not fluff for Hacktoberfest.

And most importantly, **tests must be included!**
